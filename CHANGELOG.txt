Changes

Okay, we probably should have started this earlier.  If you already have your
dissertation half-written with a previous version of the template, see the
sections labeled TRANSITION: below.


August 2004

	It was working.


8 June 2005

	Grad College has allowed electronic submission (you lucky !@#$%), so
	naturally some things have changed.  Many instances of bolding have
	been removed.

	Instead of a completely dummy Committee Approval page (page 2), we
	have set it up to print out a page ready for signing (and more
	importantly electronically including).  Since now both the title page
	and the Approval page have things like your name, the title, and the
	degree name, we have separated those out, and altered the template so
	you only have to enter them once.

	TRANSITION: Use the new class file.  There are changes to
	dissertation.tex: there are now three "variable"-like things for you
	to fill out: \completetitle{}, \fullname{}, and \degreename{};
	\maketitlepage and \approval have changed; and there are now some
	commands to go to single-spacing before the bibliography commands.
	Everything else should be the same.


23 August 2005

	Terry had \part level commands in his dissertation.  In all of the
	work we had done on the class file, we overlooked the \part level
	commands because we thought they wouldn't be used much.  So Terry
	figured out how to fix up those commands in the same way we had hacked
	the \chapter commands, so that all the relevant \part stuff is
	consistently formatted to Grad College specifications--thanks Terry.

	TRANSITION: If you do not have \part level commands in your
	dissertation, you can totally ignore this change.  If you do, only the
	uathesis.cls file has changed.

22 February 2006

	I put in commands to generate a hyperref-style PDF, which is heavily
	cross-referenced.  This is based on what Moses Milazzo did.  The
	Makefile handles the generation of the PDF files of the
	special_abstract and dissertation via the commands 'make pdf.'  To
	show the pdf of the dissertation, type 'make view_pdf' or 'make
	show_pdf'.  If you want to remove hyperref, or use different options,
	see the line \usepackage[...]{hyperref} in dissertation.tex.

	I have also added deluxetable.sty and aastex_hack.sty to the template,
	which have allowed me to use AASTEX features such as deluxe tables
	(rather than Latex's tabular environment) to typeset tables.  This was
	a major benefit, as I had already typeset these tables in AASTEX
	format for my Astrophysical Journal articles.  - Curtis Cooper

20 March 2006

	I added the grad college's manual for electronic submission of your
	dissertation: ETD_Diss_Manual.pdf.  I also added Makefile_alternate,
	which uses "rubber" instead of GNU Make to calculate interdependencies
	between Latex sources:

7 January 2009
   DAVID MINTON: A few things have been cleaned up.  The graduate college
   no longer requires spaces between the numbers of the year on the title
   page.  If you are using an old template, this should be the only change
   you need to make in the main dissertation file (dissertation.tex).  All 
	other changes were made to the uathesis.cls file.

   Some minor rewording of the Approval Form and Statement by Author to match
	the current grad college examples.  Also, for electronic dissertations, the 
	Statement by Author now has the typed name instead of a line for a signature 
	(this does not	appear to be the case for the Master Thesis for some reason). 

	Support has now been added for 3 flavors of Creative Commons licenses. 
	While trying to get the hyperlink to the CC license website in the 
	Statement by Author page to work, I ended up rewriting the call to the
	hyperref package.  I also threw out the old Makefile and used my own. 
	
	Based on the TODO I attempted to figure out the footskip issue.  This is
	supposed to be the distance between the bottom of text and the bottom of 
	the footnotes, but changing this value seems to have absolutely no 
	effect on the document.  This does not appear to be a critical issue, so
	I leave this oddity to future troubleshooters.  I have left in my 
	testing footnote on the first page of Chapter 1.

3 July 2013

	Added new template for proposals (e.g. dissertation/thesis proposal).  A
	proposal uses basically the same format as a thesis, except for minor formatting
	differences.  A proposal does not use chapters, so chapters are treated similarly
	to sections.  A chapter heading does not say "Chapter", is left-justified, and
	is not separated into 2 lines.  Also, proposals don't typically have SBA,
	dedication, or acknowledgement.

	Minor reformatting and rewording of several dissertation forms to match the
	current graduate college examples.  Also added a template folder to house the
	'current' example forms from graduate college.  The manual
	ETD_Diss_Manual.pdf is also updated and moved into the template folder.
